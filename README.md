# Mid-Term Report: Topics Learned + MNIST Digit Recogniser Project (Mid term project)

# Learning Journey Overview

This report summarizes the key topics and concepts I have studied so far in my machine learning and deep learning journey, followed by an implementation project using the MNIST dataset.

# Topics Covered:

# 1. Python & Data Libraries
- Refreshed core Python programming concepts.
- Explored NumPy and Pandas for data analysis and manipulation.
- Used Matplotlib for data visualization.

# 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Learned Regular Expressions for text matching and cleaning.
- Studied Text Preprocessing techniques: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.
- Understood Word Embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe.
- Implemented Sentiment Analysis using basic classifiers and vectorization.

# 3. Neural Networks & Deep Learning
- Understood the fundamentals of neural networks: layers, activation functions, forward and backward propagation.
- Learned about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their application to sequence data.

# Project: MNIST Digit Recogniser

# Objective
To develop a neural network using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset.

# Tools & Technologies
- Language: Python
- Libraries: PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib

# Workflow
1. Load and explore the MNIST dataset.
2. Preprocess the data: normalize and reshape.
3. Build and train a neural network using PyTorch.
4. Evaluate the model on unseen test data.

#Results & Insights

- Achieved strong performance on the digit classification task.
- Learned how to implement a training loop from scratch in PyTorch.
- Understood the importance of activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.
